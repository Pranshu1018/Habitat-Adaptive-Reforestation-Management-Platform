## 🎬 **DEMO SCRIPT**

**Say**:
> "Let me show you the complete workflow. In Planning, we analyze a site and save the project. In Planting, we record when trees are actually planted. In Monitoring, we track their health over time. All data flows through Firebase, so everything is connected and persistent."

**Show**:
1. Planning → Save project
2. Planting → Record planting
3. Monitoring → View health

**Time**: 3-5 minutes

---

## ✅ **WHAT WORKS**

- ✅ Planning saves to Firebase
- ✅ Planting loads from Firebase
- ✅ Planting saves to Firebase
- ✅ Monitoring loads from Firebase
- ✅ Data persists across sessions
- ✅ Multi-project support
- ✅ Status tracking (planned → planted)
